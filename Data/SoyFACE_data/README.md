# SoyFACE data

Above-ground soybean (cv. Pioneer 93B15) biomass data collected over the 2002 (Morgan et al. 2005), and 2004-2006 (Bishop et al. 2015) growing seasons under ambient and elevated CO2 at the SoyFACE facility in Urbana, IL.

There are two files for each year and condition, one with the mean biomasses (e.g., `2002_ambient_biomass.csv`) and an associated file with the standard deviations of the biomasses (`2002_ambient_biomass_std.csv`). These files are used to reproduce the parameter optimization and figures in Matthews et al.
